      <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
      <p>
        On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
        exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of
        installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
        elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
        ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind
        to create power.
