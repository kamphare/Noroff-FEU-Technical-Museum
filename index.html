              Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed
              to making science accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
              early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
              everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
              life itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
              experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite
              a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
              brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
              different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
              explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
              with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
              dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when
              everyone’s gone home).

              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do.
            </p>

              You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or
              why not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?
              Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds,
              so make sure you come ready to learn and explore.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
              Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
              experiment with our team of experts.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
              can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
              Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
              about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them.
